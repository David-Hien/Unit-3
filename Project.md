## Criteria A: Planning 

### Definition of Problem

My client's name is Nagisa Sato. She has a collection of shoes - both the ones currently in her possesion and the ones she would like to have. At the moment, my client does not use any application or system to organize her collection. For that reason, Nagisa wishes for an application that can store the data of her shoes and is able to organize it base on different factors as to help her keep a better track of the collection. In addition, my client wants to have a "wishlist" - list of shoes that she wants to add to her collection in the future - that is also organized to find the next pair to buy.

### Proposed Solution

My proposed solution is to create an application that uses Python, Kivymd Library, and SQLAlchemy. Python is a highly versitile programming language that supports OOP (Object-oriented programming). For this application, I believe it is more effective to approach using OOP, because it makes it easier to understand the program functions and fix bugs.

***Python***


***Kivymd Library***


***SQLAlchemy and ORM***



### Success Criteria

1. User is able to Create, Add, Edit, Delete data in the table
2. The application has a login page
3. The login information and database is secured
4. Able to transfer a row from one table to another
5. Upload image*
6. Function to sort the table based on different factors
7. Uses OOP (Object-oriented programming)
